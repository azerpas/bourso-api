# Bourso CLI

[![OpenSSF Scorecard](https://api.securityscorecards.dev/projects/github.com/azerpas/bourso-api/badge)](https://securityscorecards.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/azerpas/bourso-api)

This app aims to be a simple CLI powered by *[Bourso API](./src/bourso_api/)* to log in to your [BoursoBank/Boursorama](https://www.boursorama.com) account and achieve some basic tasks.

The first goal is to be able to [DCA (Dollar Cost Average)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp) on given [ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp) on a regular basis with your Bourso account.

A [GitHub issue follows the progress](https://github.com/azerpas/bourso-api/issues/1).

## Usage
You can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/azerpas/bourso-api/releases).

Choose the right binary for your OS between:
- `bourso-cli-darwin.tar.gz` for MacOS
- `bourso-cli-linux.tar.gz` for Linux
- `bourso-cli.exe` for Windows

On MacOS, make sure to make the file is executable:
```sh
chmod +x bourso-cli
# if it still says `Permission denied`, try
chown 777 bourso-cli
```
If you then get a `"bourso-cli" cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified` error, go to `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General` and click `Open Anyway`

‚ö†Ô∏è Signing in with a different IP address than the ones you usually use will trigger a security check from Bourso. You'll have to validate the connection from your phone. A [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/azerpas/bourso-api/pull/10) is open to handle this case.

### Verify your installation
Bourso CLI embeds [SLSA](https://slsa.dev/) standard to verify the integrity of the binary. You can verify the signature of the binary by:
- Downloading the provenance generated by the release pipeline for your OS: https://github.com/azerpas/bourso-api/releases/latest
- Installing [slsa-verifier](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)
- Running `slsa-verifier`. MacOS example:
```sh
slsa-verifier-darwin-arm64 verify-artifact --provenance-path provenance-id-macos-latest.intoto.jsonl --source-uri "github.com/azerpas/bourso-api" bourso-cli
```
Which should output:
```
Verifying artifact ~/bourso-cli: PASSED
```

### Configuration
Save your client ID with this config command:
```
./bourso-cli config
```
The password will be asked each time you run the app to avoid storing it in a file.

### Get your accounts
```
./bourso-cli accounts
```
You'll get something like this:
```
[
    Account {
        id: "1a2953bd1a28a37bd3fe89d32986e613",
        name: "BoursoBank",
        balance: 100,
        bank_name: "BoursoBank",
        kind: Banking,
    },
    Account {
        id: "a583f3c5842c34fb00b408486ef493e0",
        name: "PEA DOE",
        balance: 1000000,
        bank_name: "BoursoBank",
        kind: Trading,
    },
]
```

### Place an order
**Make sure to have a trading account with enough balance to place the order.** Check the previous section to see how to get your account ID.

üõçÔ∏è Place a buy order for 4 shares of the ETF "1rTCW8" (AMUNDI MSCI WORLD UCITS ETF - EUR) on your account "a583f3c5842c34fb00b408486ef493e0":
```
./bourso-cli trade order new --side buy --symbol 1rTCW8 --account a583f3c5842c34fb00b408486ef493e0 --quantity 4
```

*Tip: You can get the ETF ID from the tracker URL, e.g. "AMUNDI MSCI WORLD UCITS ETF - EUR" url is https://www.boursorama.com/bourse/trackers/cours/1rTCW8/ (1rTCW8)*

### DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) investing

You can use this script to do DCA investing. For example, if you want to buy 1 share of the ETF "1rTCW8" (AMUNDI MSCI WORLD UCITS ETF - EUR) every month, you can use a cron job to run the script every month.

#### With MacOS
You can use the `launchd` daemon to run the script every week. Create a file named `com.bourso-cli.plist` in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` with the following content:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.azerpas.bourso-cli</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/Users/YOUR_USER/bourso-launchd.sh</string>
    </array>
    <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>
    <dict>
        <key>Weekday</key>
        <integer>1</integer> <!-- Run the script every Monday -->
        <key>Hour</key>
        <integer>20</integer> <!-- Run the script at 08:00 PM -->
        <key>Minute</key>
        <integer>00</integer>
    </dict>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/> <!-- Run the script when the agent is loaded, i.e., when the system starts -->
    <key>StandardOutPath</key>
    <string>/Users/YOUR_USER/bourso-launchd-cli-stdout.log</string>
    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string>/Users/YOUR_USER/bourso-launchd-cli-stderr.log</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```
Replace `YOUR_USER` with your username.

Then copy the `bourso-launchd.sh` script in your home directory, modify the variables and make it executable.
```sh
chmod +x bourso-launchd.sh
chown 777 bourso-launchd.sh
```
Finally, load the agent with the following command:
```sh
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.bourso-cli.plist
```
The script will now run every week at 08:00 PM on Monday. You can check the logs in `~/bourso-launchd-cli-stdout.log` and `~/bourso-launchd-cli-stderr.log`.
